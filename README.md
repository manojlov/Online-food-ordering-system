# PSN Foods

A Simple website for ordering food online. We added the abilities to register and login a user in order to make the offered orders. The other side is the Admin panel where the admin can manage the foods, categories and see the orders.
We used Html, css, javascript, ajax for the frontend and php and mysqli for the backend.

How to run the project:
-First download the zip, and uncompress it. 
-Copy the uncompressed file into xampp/htdocs
-Import the database on http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
-Open the project http://localhost/Project/foods.php
